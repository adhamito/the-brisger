# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Bridger website aims to showcase how AI can transform various sectors in Morocco. To make the website more engaging and visually appealing, we need to enhance the 3D backgrounds and animations throughout the site. This enhancement will create a more immersive experience that better represents the innovative nature of the project while maintaining good performance and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Hero Section 3D Background

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an impressive and interactive 3D background in the hero section, so that I'm immediately engaged with the website's innovative theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a high-quality 3D particle animation that responds to user interaction
2. WHEN the 3D animation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a frame rate of at least 30 FPS on mid-range devices
3. WHEN a user moves their cursor over the hero section THEN the system SHALL create subtle interactive effects with the 3D elements
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL ensure the 3D elements gracefully animate in with smooth transitions
5. IF the user's device has limited capabilities THEN the system SHALL fall back to a simpler version of the animation
6. WHEN the hero section is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adjust the complexity of the 3D scene to maintain performance

### Requirement 2: Sectional 3D Backgrounds

**User Story:** As a user navigating through different sections of the website, I want each section to have unique but cohesive 3D visual elements, so that the visual experience remains engaging throughout my visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls to the About section THEN the system SHALL display a distinct 3D background that represents connectivity and community
2. WHEN a user scrolls to the Ideas section THEN the system SHALL display 3D elements that visually represent the different AI application domains (education, agriculture, healthcare, transport)
3. WHEN transitioning between sections THEN the system SHALL implement smooth 3D transition effects
4. WHEN any section is in view THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable against the 3D backgrounds
5. IF a section contains important interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure the 3D background doesn't interfere with usability

### Requirement 3: Interactive 3D Elements for Ideas Showcase

**User Story:** As a user exploring the AI ideas, I want to interact with 3D models representing each sector, so that I can better visualize and understand the applications of AI in these domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over an idea card THEN the system SHALL display a 3D animation effect specific to that sector
2. WHEN a user clicks on "Learn More" for an idea THEN the system SHALL show a modal with a more detailed 3D visualization of the concept
3. WHEN the 3D models are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are thematically appropriate for each sector (education, agriculture, healthcare, transport)
4. WHEN a 3D model is interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through animation changes
5. IF a user is on a touch device THEN the system SHALL adapt the interactions to be touch-friendly

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user with varying device capabilities, I want the website to perform smoothly regardless of my hardware, so that I can enjoy the experience without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading of 3D assets to minimize initial load time
2. WHEN 3D elements are not in the viewport THEN the system SHALL pause or reduce their rendering to save resources
3. IF the user's device shows performance issues THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce the complexity of 3D elements
4. WHEN the system detects a low-end device THEN the system SHALL offer a "lite mode" option that reduces visual complexity
5. WHEN 3D assets are loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators or placeholder animations

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Considerations

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want to be able to experience the website's content even if I cannot fully perceive the 3D elements, so that I'm not excluded from the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a screen reader is detected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alternative descriptions for 3D elements
2. WHEN a user has enabled reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL minimize or eliminate animations
3. WHEN the website is used with keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive 3D elements are accessible
4. IF 3D elements contain important information THEN the system SHALL provide alternative ways to access that information
5. WHEN color is used in 3D elements to convey meaning THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient contrast and alternative cues
